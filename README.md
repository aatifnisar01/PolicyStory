# PolicyStory

In the era of information overload, traditional news consumption through both online and print media often fails to provide a structured and longitudinal understanding of complex socio-political issues. To address this gap, we present PolicyStory, an information tool designed to offer lucid, chronological, and summarized insights into Indian policy issues. PolicyStory collects news articles from diverse sources, clusters them by topic, and generates three levels of summaries from longitudinal media discourse on policies, leveraging open source large language models. A user study around the tool indicated that PolicyStory effectively aided users in grasping policy developments over time, with positive feedback highlighting its usability and clarity of summaries. By providing users a birdsâ€™ eye view of complex policy topics, PolicyStory serves as a valuable tool for fostering informed civic engagement.
